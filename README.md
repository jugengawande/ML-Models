It is more satisfying to write your own algorithms than doing _import sklearn_ . 

In this repo I build machine learning algorithms from <strong>scratch</strong>. All the models are implemented in my favorite programming langauage Python. 

Often we learn ML either theoretically, wherein it's all mathematics (honestly how boring) or in application context and refer all our ouotcomes as under the hood it's doing magic! Don't get me wrong, it's still a wonderful magic trick but with this repo I try to establish a balance between the math and application of ML algorithms. You will see math sprinkled in comments, in between the code and thats just me making sense of what's happening. 

All algorithms are tested against standard dataset used traditionally while learning ML models.
